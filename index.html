        Our motivation is to provide versatility and dexterity to a robot.
        Robots show accurate and efficient operation and establish a leading position in some areas, but many tasks are still performed by human operators.
        We think robots should have more intelligence and dexterity for handling such works and pioneering new applications.
        <strong>As part of this purpose, our team developed a core system that improves the agility of robots</strong>.
      </p>
      <p lang="en" class="text char-gray">
        How can we make robots dexterous? Why a human can acquire both versatility and dexterity?
        We started by mimicking a human motor control system, including a receptor, central nervous system, and effector.
        Human actions are roughly classified into 3 patterns:
        <span class="nowrap">&#9312; deliberative</span> motion via a cerebrum, <span class="nowrap">&#9313; coordinating</span> motion via a cerebellum, and <span class="nowrap">&#9314; reflex</span> motion through a spinal cord.
        Those complementary motions have unique functionality and dexterity, and each system also has a task-specific architecture, respectively.
      </p>

      <p lang="en" class="text char-gray">
        Imitating a human motor control system, hierarchical control systems have been developed so far.
        Most systems focused on achieving intelligence, and those systems make robots versatile.
        However, few systems include a reflex center, which secures dexterity.
        Fine control and disturbance suppression cannot be achieved unless a robot operates its actuator freely and quickly.
        A problem is that making that system is difficult because it requires an interdisciplinary system design that integrates a fast reception system, computing system, and drive system.
        Against such a background, <strong>we are working to construct a responsive system with collaborating experts in each field, toward providing agility to robots</strong>.
        We believe improving dexterity expands the availability of robots.

            The agility of a robot depends on the drive performance of actuators.
            Wereas, feasible functions are determined by the number of actuators.
            Considering both requirements, we developed a compact and wideband motor driver.
